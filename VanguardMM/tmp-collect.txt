Because the fund’s income is based on short-term interest rates—which can fluctuate significantly over short periods—income risk is expected to be high. A low or negative interest rate environment will adversely affect the fund’s return. Low or negative interest rates, depending on their duration and severity, could prevent the fund from, among other things, providing a positive yield and/or maintaining a stable share price of $1.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security, including restricted securities, in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Structured products risk</b>. The fund may invest in structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Regional risk</b>, which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li></ul>"

Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall New York municipal market.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline. Credit risk should be very low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Because the fund’s income is based on short-term interest rates—which can fluctuate significantly over short periods—income risk is expected to be high. A low or negative interest rate environment will adversely affect the fund’s return. Low or negative interest rates, depending on their duration and severity, could prevent the fund from, among other things, providing a positive yield and/or maintaining a stable share price of $1.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Structured products risk</b>. The fund may invest in structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li></ul>"

Keep in mind that investments that offer stability of principal typically are the most vulnerable to income risk—the possibility that the income from the investment will fluctuate over brief periods—and tend to produce lower long-term returns than riskier assets. Such funds are appropriate for the short-term reserves portion of a long-term investment portfolio, for investors with short-term investment horizons (no longer than three years), and for investors whose tolerance for share-price fluctuations is very low or whose employment or financial situation is precarious.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:&#160; <ul> <li><strong>Income risk:</strong> The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li> <li><strong>Interest rate risk:</strong> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in short-term bonds, whose prices are much less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of longer term bonds.</li> <li><strong>Credit risk:</strong> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low to moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered high- and medium-quality.</li> <li><strong>Call risk:</strong> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income.</li> <li><strong>Extension risk:</strong> The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally low for short-term bond funds.</li> <li><strong>Liquidity risk:</strong> The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price. Liquidity risk is generally low for short-term bond funds.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk:</strong> The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> </ul><UL></UL>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (4 to 10 years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Prepayment risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage’s principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, extension risk is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>, the fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (4 to 10 years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk:</b> The chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund’s income declines when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Call risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Prepayment risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage’s principal and may be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Extension risk:</b> The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, extension risk is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates.</li><li><b>Credit risk:</b> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk:</b> The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b> The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have more variable economic performance; greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk:</b> The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b> The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency hedging risk:</b> The fund has the ability to invest in foreign bonds which may or may not be denominated in or hedged back to U.S. dollars. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposure. By entering into currency hedging transactions, the fund may eliminate any chance to benefit from favorable fluctuations in relevant currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Manager risk:</b> The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk:</b> The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Counterparty risk:</b> The chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract, or other investment vehicle, with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond or loan issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond or loan to decline. Credit risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in junk bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be high for the fund because of the high percentage of callable bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate to high for the fund, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond or loan prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be moderate for the fund.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index. Index sampling risk for the fund is expected to be low.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be moderate for the fund.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low to moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered high-quality or medium-quality.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the financial sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider.

      "level": "Conservative to Moderate",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as conservative to moderate are subject to low-to-moderate fluctuations in share prices. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (4 to 10 years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>: The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>: The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>: The chance that during periods of rising interest rate rates, certain debt obligations will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest&nbsp;or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>: The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>: The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (four to ten years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Prepayment risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage’s principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Prepayment risk should be moderate for the fund.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. This will lengthen the duration or average life of those securities and delay a fund’s ability to reinvest proceeds at higher interest rates, making a fund more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, there is a chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates. Extension risk should be moderate for the fund.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a small portion of its assets in callable bonds.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index. Index sampling risk for the fund is expected to be low.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li></ul>",

The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Prepayment risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, homeowners will refinance their mortgages before their maturity dates, resulting in prepayment of mortgage-backed securities held by the fund. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the mortgage’s principal and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such prepayments and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Prepayment risk should be moderate for the fund.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. This will lengthen the duration or average life of those securities and delay a fund’s ability to reinvest proceeds at higher interest rates, making a fund more sensitive to changes in interest rates. For funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, there is a chance that during periods of rising interest rates, homeowners will repay their mortgages at slower rates. Extension risk should be moderate for the fund.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a small portion of its assets in callable bonds.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index. Index sampling risk for the fund is expected to be low.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li></ul>",

Keep in mind that investments that offer stability of principal typically are the most vulnerable to income risk—the possibility that the income from the investment will fluctuate over brief periods—and tend to produce lower long-term returns than riskier assets. Such funds are appropriate for the short-term reserves portion of a long-term investment portfolio, for investors with short-term investment horizons (no longer than three years), and for investors whose tolerance for share-price fluctuations is very low or whose employment or financial situation is precarious.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Income fluctuations: </b>The fund’s quarterly income distributions are likely to fluctuate considerably more than the income distributions of a typical bond fund. Income fluctuations associated with changes in interest rates are expected to be low; however, income fluctuations associated with changes in inflation are expected to be high. Overall, investors can expect income fluctuations to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk: </b>The chance that the value of a bond will fluctuate due to a change in the level of interest rates. Although inflation-indexed bonds seek to provide inflation protection, their prices may decline when interest rates rise and vice versa. Because the fund’s dollar-weighted average maturity is expected to be 5 years or less, interest rate risk is expected to be low for the fund.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk, </b>which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds are classified as conservative if their share prices are expected to remain stable or to fluctuate only slightly. Keep in mind that investments that offer stability of principal typically are the most vulnerable to income risk—the possibility that the income from the investment will fluctuate over brief periods—and tend to produce lower long-term returns than riskier assets. Such funds are appropriate for the short-term reserves portion of a long-term investment portfolio, for investors with short-term investment horizons (no longer than three years), and for investors whose tolerance for share-price fluctuations is very low or whose employment or financial situation is precarious.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Income fluctuations: </b>The fund’s quarterly income distributions are likely to fluctuate considerably more than the income distributions of a typical bond fund. Income fluctuations associated with changes in interest rates are expected to be low; however, income fluctuations associated with changes in inflation are expected to be high. Overall, investors can expect income fluctuations to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk: </b>The chance that the value of a bond will fluctuate due to a change in the level of interest rates. Although inflation-indexed bonds seek to provide inflation protection, their prices may decline when interest rates rise and vice versa. Because the fund’s dollar-weighted average maturity is expected to be 5 years or less, interest rate risk is expected to be low for the fund.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk, </b>which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Country/regional risk: </b>The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, periods &nbsp;of financial volatility, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk: </b>The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk is especially high for the fund.</li><li><b>Currency risk: </b>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Credit risk: </b>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in both investment-grade and below investment-grade bonds (also known as high-yield or junk bonds), credit risk should be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk: </b>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk: </b>The chance that the use of derivatives—such as futures contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, swap agreements, and options—can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying security, asset, index, or reference rate. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying securities or assets. Also, a liquid market may not always exist for the fund’s derivative positions at times when the fund might wish to terminate or sell. The use of a derivative subjects the investor to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty (i.e., counterparty risk), potentially resulting in delayed or partial payment or even nonpayment of amounts due under the derivative contract.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk: </b>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund based on expected sensitivity of the portfolio to interest rate movements.</li><li><b>Income risk: </b>The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate for the fund, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Call risk: </b>The chance that during periods of low or falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate are subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices. This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Country/regional risk: </b>The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, periods &nbsp;of financial volatility, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk: </b>The chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk is especially high for the fund.</li><li><b>Currency risk: </b>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Credit risk: </b>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in both investment-grade and below investment-grade bonds (also known as high-yield or junk bonds), credit risk should be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk: </b>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk: </b>The chance that the use of derivatives—such as futures contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, swap agreements, and options—can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying security, asset, index, or reference rate. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying securities or assets. Also, a liquid market may not always exist for the fund’s derivative positions at times when the fund might wish to terminate or sell. The use of a derivative subjects the investor to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty (i.e., counterparty risk), potentially resulting in delayed or partial payment or even nonpayment of amounts due under the derivative contract.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk: </b>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund based on expected sensitivity of the portfolio to interest rate movements.</li><li><b>Income risk: </b>The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate for the fund, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Call risk: </b>The chance that during periods of low or falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk should be low for the fund.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk is high for the fund.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the bonds issued by a small number of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be high for the fund because it invests a large portion of its assets in bonds rated below investment-grade (also known as high-yield or junk bonds).</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be moderate for the fund, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index.

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index. Index sampling risk for the fund is expected to be low.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",

Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund’s income declines when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in junk bonds, credit risk should be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have more variable economic performance; greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk should be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency hedging risk,</b> The fund has the ability to invest in foreign bonds which may or may not be denominated in or hedged back to U.S. dollars. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposure. By entering into currency hedging transactions, the fund may eliminate any chance to benefit from favorable fluctuations in relevant currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>, The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Counterparty risk</b>, which is the chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract, or other investment vehicle, with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations.</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate are subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices. This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund’s income declines when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds and moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Because the fund invests in junk bonds, credit risk should be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in emerging market countries will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging market countries can have more variable economic performance; greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets. Emerging markets risk should be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, government-owned corporations, and foreign companies. Because the fund may invest its assets in bonds of issuers located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging market countries.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency hedging risk,</b> The fund has the ability to invest in foreign bonds which may or may not be denominated in or hedged back to U.S. dollars. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened or overhedges a currency that has strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposure. By entering into currency hedging transactions, the fund may eliminate any chance to benefit from favorable fluctuations in relevant currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>, The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Counterparty risk</b>, which is the chance that the counterparty to a currency forward contract, or other investment vehicle, with the fund is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations.</li></ul>",

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk:</b> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests in a diverse mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Credit risk:</b> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Call risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupons or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as&nbsp;<i>prepayment risk</i>. Call/prepayment risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a small portion of its assets in callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk:</b> The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by foreign companies, governments, or government agencies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in a particular country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk for the fund is high.</li><li><b>Currency hedging risk:</b> The risk that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund’s foreign currency exposures. The fund seeks to mimic the performance of foreign bonds without regard to currency exchange rate fluctuations. To accomplish this goal, the fund attempts to offset, or hedge, its foreign currency exposures by entering into currency hedging transactions. However, it generally is not possible to perfectly hedge the fund’s foreign currency exposures. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened, or overhedges a currency that has strengthened, relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Currency hedging risk for the fund is low.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk:</b> The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk,&nbsp;</b>which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. As the fund tracks its target index, the fund could fluctuate between nondiversified and diversified status as a result of an index rebalance or market movement. The fund could then be subject to nondiversification risk, which results when a fund invests a greater percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li></ul>",

    "risk": {
      "code": 2,
      "level": "Conservative to Moderate",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to conservative are subject to low-to-moderate fluctuations in share prices. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (four to ten years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk:</b> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests in a diverse mix of short-, intermediate-, and long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Income risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Credit risk:</b> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Call risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupons or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as&nbsp;<i>prepayment risk</i>. Call/prepayment risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a small portion of its assets in callable bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk:</b> The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by foreign companies, governments, or government agencies. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in bonds of issuers located in a particular country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk for the fund is high.</li><li><b>Currency hedging risk:</b> The risk that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund’s foreign currency exposures. The fund seeks to mimic the performance of foreign bonds without regard to currency exchange rate fluctuations. To accomplish this goal, the fund attempts to offset, or hedge, its foreign currency exposures by entering into currency hedging transactions. However, it generally is not possible to perfectly hedge the fund’s foreign currency exposures. The fund will decline in value if it underhedges a currency that has weakened, or overhedges a currency that has strengthened, relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition, the fund will incur expenses to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Currency hedging risk for the fund is low.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk:</b> The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk,&nbsp;</b>which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of bonds issued by just a few issuers or even a single issuer. As the fund tracks its target index, the fund could fluctuate between nondiversified and diversified status as a result of an index rebalance or market movement. The fund could then be subject to nondiversification risk, which results when a fund invests a greater percentage of its assets in bonds issued by a small number of issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li></ul>",

Keep in mind that investments that offer stability of principal typically are the most vulnerable to income risk—the possibility that the income from the investment will fluctuate over brief periods—and tend to produce lower long-term returns than riskier assets. Such funds are appropriate for the short-term reserves portion of a long-term investment portfolio, for investors with short-term investment horizons (no longer than three years), and for investors whose tolerance for share-price fluctuations is very low or whose employment or financial situation is precarious.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk, but you could still lose money by investing in it. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally high for short-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in short-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of longer-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally low for short-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally low for short-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. In general, credit risk should be relatively low for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered to be of high quality.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security, including restricted securities, in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives and structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal securities combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Regional risk</b>, which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors with medium-term investment horizons (4 to 10 years), for those seeking an investment that emphasizes income rather than growth, and for investors who have a low tolerance for the risk of short-term price fluctuations.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>State-specific risk</b>, which is the chance that developments in California, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by California and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in California than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall California municipal market.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that a fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li></ul>",

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>State-specific risk</b>, which is the chance that developments in California, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by California and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in California than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall California municipal market.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that a fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li></ul>",

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds, so investors should expect the fund’s monthly income to fluctuate accordingly.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because it invests primarily in short- and intermediate-term bonds, whose prices are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally moderate for intermediate-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. In general, credit risk should be relatively low for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered to be of high quality.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives and structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal bonds combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Regional risk</b>, which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate are subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices. This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. As a tax-advantaged investment, the fund is potentially vulnerable to federal and state tax-law changes. Also, part of the fund’s return may consist of capital gains distributions that are taxable in the same way that realized capital gains on any investment are taxable. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>State-specific risk: </b>The chance that developments in California, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by California and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in California than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall California municipal market.</li><li><b>Credit risk: </b>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk: </b>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk: </b>The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income.</li><li><b>Extension risk: </b>The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk: </b>The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk: </b>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk: </b>The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Tax risk: </b>The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li></ul>",

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be relatively moderate for the fund because it invests a portion of its assets in moderate to low-quality bonds.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally high for high-yield bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for high-yield bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives and structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal bonds combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Regional risk</b>, which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate are subject to a moderate degree of fluctuations in share prices. This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be relatively moderate for the fund because it invests a portion of its assets in moderate to low-quality bonds.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally high for high-yield bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for high-yield bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives and structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal bonds combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Regional risk</b>, which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. In general, credit risk should be relatively low for the fund because it invests primarily in bonds that are considered to be of high quality.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives and structured products such as tender option bonds and long-term municipal bonds combined with a demand feature (e.g., variable rate demand notes or VRDNs), which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li><li><b>Regional risk</b>, which is the chance that economic, political, or regulatory occurrences within a certain state may adversely affect the value of securities offered by issuers located within that state. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities located in any one state, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are&#160;more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</LI> <LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. </LI> <LI><strong>Extension risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</LI> <LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. </LI> <LI><strong>Liquidity risk: </strong>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</LI> <LI><strong>Manager risk: </strong>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. </LI> <LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with&#160;diversified mutual funds.</LI> <LI><strong>Tax risk: </strong>The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</LI> </UL>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions:</p><ul><li><b>State-specific risk</b>, which is the chance that developments in New Jersey, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by New Jersey and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in New Jersey than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall New Jersey municipal market.</li><li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. Call risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Extension risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates. Income risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li></ul>",

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. As a tax-advantaged investment, the fund is potentially vulnerable to federal and state tax-law changes. Also, part of the fund’s return may consist of capital gains distributions that are taxable in the same way that realized capital gains on any investment are taxable. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>State-specific risk:</b> The chance that developments in New York, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by New York and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in New York than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall New York municipal market. The chance that developments in , such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by New York and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in New York than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall New York municipal market.</li><li><b>Credit risk:</b> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk:</b> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</li><li><b>Call risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income.</li><li><b>Extension risk:</b> The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</li><li><b>Income risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk:</b> The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li><li><b>Manager risk:</b> The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Tax risk:</b> The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</li></ul>",

Also, part of the fund&#8217;s return may consist of capital gains distributions that are taxable in the same way that realized capital gains on any investment are taxable.The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<UL><LI><strong>State-specific risk: : </strong>The chance that developments in Ohio, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by Ohio and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in Ohio than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall Ohio municipal market.</LI> <LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest&#160;or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. </LI> <LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are&#160;more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</LI> <LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. </LI> <LI><strong>Extension risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</LI> <LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. </LI> <LI><strong>Liquidity risk: </strong>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</LI> <LI><strong>Manager risk: </strong>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. </LI> <LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with&#160;diversified mutual funds.</LI> <LI><strong>Tax risk: </strong>The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</LI> </UL>",

This price volatility may be due to one of several factors: 1) a fund may hold longer-term bonds, which are subject to wide swings in value as interest rates rise and fall; 2) a fund may hold income-oriented common stocks; and 3) a fund may hold a balance of both stocks and bonds. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall bond market. As a tax-advantaged investment, the fund is potentially vulnerable to federal and state tax-law changes. Also, part of the fund&#8217;s return may consist of capital gains distributions that are taxable in the same way that realized capital gains on any investment are taxable. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by:<UL><LI><strong>State-specific risk: </strong>The chance that developments in Pennsylvania, such as tax, legislative, or political changes, will adversely affect the securities held by the fund. Because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by Pennsylvania and its municipalities, it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in Pennsylvania than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states. Unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have far-reaching ramifications on the overall Pennsylvania municipal market.</LI> <LI><strong>Credit risk: </strong>The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest&#160;or principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer&#8217;s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. </LI> <LI><strong>Interest rate risk: </strong>The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in long-term bonds, whose prices are&#160;more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shorter-term bonds.</LI> <LI><strong>Call risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond&#8217;s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund&#8217;s income. </LI> <LI><strong>Extension risk: </strong>The chance that during periods of rising interest rates, certain debt securities will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated, and the value of those securities may fall. Extension risk is generally high for long-term bond funds.</LI> <LI><strong>Income risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s income will decline because of falling interest rates. </LI> <LI><strong>Liquidity risk: </strong>The chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</LI> <LI><strong>Manager risk: </strong>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. </LI> <LI><strong>Nondiversification risk: </strong>The chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with&#160;diversified mutual funds.</LI> <LI><strong>Tax risk: </strong>The chance that all or a portion of the tax-exempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable, possibly with retroactive effect, because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state or local tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer.</LI> </UL>",

The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk:</b> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li><li><b>Call risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income.</li><li><b>Credit risk:</b> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk:</b> The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.</li></ul>",

Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. In addition to the risks inherent in the asset classes of the underlying funds, the fund also is subject to asset allocation risk, which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a relatively long investment horizon (more than five years), are able to tolerate moderate-to-high short-term fluctuations in price, and wish to achieve some combination of current income and modest growth potential.</p>",

However, based on the fund’s current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund’s overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>Because the fund invests substantially all of its assets in underlying Vanguard funds, it is subject to underlying fund risk. This means that the fund is exposed to all of the risks associated with the investment strategies and policies of the underlying Vanguard funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. As the underlying funds invest in stocks and bonds the fund is subject to several stock and bond market risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. However, based on the fund’s current allocation between stocks and the less volatile asset class of bonds, the fund’s overall level of risk should be higher than those funds that invest the majority of their assets in bonds, but lower than those investing entirely in stocks. As the fund’s allocation among underlying funds gradually changes, the fund’s overall level of risk also will decline. The fund also is subject to <i>asset allocation risk,</i> which is the chance that the selection of underlying funds and the allocation of fund assets will cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar investment objective. Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year 2060 when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in the Target Retirement 2060 Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date. For further details on all risks, please refer to the fund’s prospectus.</p>",

Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The benchmark index for the stock portion of the fund tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the fund’s benchmark index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector. <b>Investment style risk</b> is the chance that returns from large- and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large- and mid-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li></ul>",

Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:</b> The chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently. Mid-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility than large-cap stocks because, among other things, medium-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk:</b> The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates.</li><li><b>Income risk:</b> The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.</li><li><b>Credit risk:</b> The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.</li><li><b>Call risk:</b> The chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income.</li><li><b>Manager risk:</b> The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

Mid- and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks because, among other things, mid-size companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign stocks. Country/regional risk is the chance that world events – such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters – will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Currency risk is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Country/regional risk and currency risk are especially high in emerging markets. The fund is also subject to manager risk, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li>\n</ul>\n"

The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s portfolio turnover rate. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk. The fund is also subject to the following risks associated with investments in foreign bonds: country/regional risk, which is the chance that world events – such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters – will adversely affect the value and/or liquidity of securities issued by foreign governments, government agencies, or companies; currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates; and currency hedging risk, which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund’s foreign currency exposure.</li>\n<li>With approximately 30% to 40% of its assets allocated to U.S. and foreign equity securities, the fund is proportionately subject to the following stock risks: stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline; and investment style risk, which is the chance that returns from mid- and large-capitalization dividend-paying value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Mid- and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general.

Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of governments, government agencies, or companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area.</li>\n<li><b>Income risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund's income will decline because of falling interest rates. A fund holding bonds will experience a decline in income when interest rates fall because the fund then must invest new cash flow and cash from maturing bonds in lower-yielding bonds.</li>\n<li><b>Interest rate risk</b>, which is the chance that bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be moderate for the fund because the fund invests only a portion of its assets in bonds and because the average duration of the fund’s bond portfolio is generally intermediate-term. The prices of short- and intermediate-term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.</li>\n<li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li>\n<li><b>Currency hedging risk</b>, which is the chance that the currency hedging transactions entered into by the fund may not perfectly offset the fund’s foreign currency exposure.</li>\n<li><b>Credit risk</b>, which is the chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it invests only a portion of its assets in bonds, most of which are considered to be of high quality.</li>\n<li><b>Call risk</b>, which is the chance that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of callable bonds may call (redeem) securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates. The fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, resulting in a decline in the fund’s income. Such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund's portfolio turnover rate. For mortgage-backed securities, this risk is known as prepayment risk.</li>\n<li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner at a desired price.</li>\n<li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li>\n</ul>\n"

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940.&nbsp; The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, large-and mid-cap stocks, such as those held by the fund, each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>ESG investing risks:</b> The fund is subject to ESG investing risks. The index provider selects securities for the Index based on the ESG criteria disclosed in the fund’s principal investment strategies. Using ESG criteria could result in the fund investing in securities that trail the returns of other funds that use ESG criteria or in the fund underperforming the market as a whole.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk, </b>which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, large-and mid-cap stocks, such as those held by the fund, each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>ESG investing risks:</b> The fund is subject to ESG investing risks. The index provider selects securities for the Index based on the ESG criteria disclosed in the fund’s principal investment strategies. Using ESG criteria could result in the fund investing in securities that trail the returns of other funds that use ESG criteria or in the fund underperforming the market as a whole.

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that returns from dividend-paying stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Specific types of stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk: </b>The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks. The fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk:&nbsp;</b>Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940.&nbsp; The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

      "code": 4,
      "level": "Moderate to Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time, and the entire amount invested could be lost. There can be no assurance that the fund’s investment objective or strategies will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Strategy risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s investment strategy will not succeed. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to limit exposure to general stock market risk or produce returns that exceed the returns of 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The fund’s use of short sales in combination with its long positions in an attempt to improve performance or to reduce overall portfolio risk may not be successful and may result in greater losses or lower positive returns than if the fund held only long positions. When the general stock market is performing strongly, the fund is expected to underperform the market because the fund’s short positions will likely lose money. If the fund’s market neutral strategy is unsuccessful, the fund may be subject to stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.</li><li><b>Short-selling risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund will lose money in connection with its short sales of securities. Short selling allows an investor to profit from declines in the prices of securities. To engage in a short sale, the fund must “borrow” securities for a fee. To close out short positions, the fund may have to sell related long positions at disadvantageous times to produce cash to unwind a short position. There is no guarantee that the price of the borrowed securities will decline; in fact, it may rise. The fund’s loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited, because there is no upward limit on the price a borrowed security could attain. Short selling involves higher transaction costs than long-only investing, which could offset any gains and increase any losses.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection or strategy execution will cause the fund to fail to achieve its investment objective or to underperform other funds with a similar investment strategy. The advisor’s security selection process may not eliminate all stock market risk factors associated with the long and short positions it establishes for the fund. It is possible that the stocks the fund holds long will decline in value at the same time that the stocks it holds short increase in value, thereby increasing potential losses to the fund. Any gain from a short position may be partially or totally offset by a decline in a long position, or vice versa.</li><li><b>Investment risk</b>, which is the chance that the types of securities purchased by the fund will, intentionally or unintentionally, increase the fund’s sensitivity to certain investment factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, market capitalization ranges, styles (growth/value), and industries of the underlying securities. These factors may cause the fund to fail to achieve its investment objective of limiting exposure to general stock market risk or cause it to underperform other funds with a similar investment strategy.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>,&nbsp;The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li></ul>",

      "level": "Moderate to Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time, and the entire amount invested could be lost. There can be no assurance that the fund’s investment objective or strategies will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Strategy risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s investment strategy will not succeed. There is no guarantee that the fund will be able to limit exposure to general stock market risk or produce returns that exceed the returns of 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The fund’s use of short sales in combination with its long positions in an attempt to improve performance or to reduce overall portfolio risk may not be successful and may result in greater losses or lower positive returns than if the fund held only long positions. When the general stock market is performing strongly, the fund is expected to underperform the market because the fund’s short positions will likely lose money. If the fund’s market neutral strategy is unsuccessful, the fund may be subject to stock market risk, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices.</li><li><b>Short-selling risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund will lose money in connection with its short sales of securities. Short selling allows an investor to profit from declines in the prices of securities. To engage in a short sale, the fund must “borrow” securities for a fee. To close out short positions, the fund may have to sell related long positions at disadvantageous times to produce cash to unwind a short position. There is no guarantee that the price of the borrowed securities will decline; in fact, it may rise. The fund’s loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited, because there is no upward limit on the price a borrowed security could attain. Short selling involves higher transaction costs than long-only investing, which could offset any gains and increase any losses.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor security selection or strategy execution will cause the fund to fail to achieve its investment objective or to underperform other funds with a similar investment strategy. The advisor’s security selection process may not eliminate all stock market risk factors associated with the long and short positions it establishes for the fund. It is possible that the stocks the fund holds long will decline in value at the same time that the stocks it holds short increase in value, thereby increasing potential losses to the fund. Any gain from a short position may be partially or totally offset by a decline in a long position, or vice versa.</li><li><b>Investment risk</b>, which is the chance that the types of securities purchased by the fund will, intentionally or unintentionally, increase the fund’s sensitivity to certain investment factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, market capitalization ranges, styles (growth/value), and industries of the underlying securities. These factors may cause the fund to fail to achieve its investment objective of limiting exposure to general stock market risk or cause it to underperform other funds with a similar investment strategy.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>,&nbsp;The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li></ul>",

The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk</b>, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks and growth stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better or worse than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>. The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund’s use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund’s performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund’s performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund’s performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund’s shareholders.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund’s target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund’s total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund’s total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk</b>, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better or worse than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940.&nbsp; The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>: The chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: In order to closely track the composition of the fund’s target index, the fund’s total assets are invested in multiple issuers representing more than 5% of the fund’s total assets. As a result, the fund may become nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, although it continues to hold multiple stocks across a number of sectors. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the Fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li></ul>",

      "level": "Moderate to Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as moderate to aggressive are broadly diversified but are subject to wide fluctuations in share price because they hold virtually all of their assets in common stocks. In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that returns from large-capitalization growth stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk,</b>&nbsp;which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks:</b>&nbsp;The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk:</b>&nbsp;In order to closely track the composition of the fund’s target index, the fund’s total assets are invested in multiple issuers representing more than 5% of the fund’s total assets. As a result, the fund may become nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, although it continues to hold multiple stocks across a number of sectors. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the Fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li><li><b>Sector risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, and rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li></ul>",

Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that returns from large-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk,</b>&nbsp;which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks:</b>&nbsp;The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market.

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from U.S. stock markets. Specific types of stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better or worse than other segments of the U.S. stock market. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that returns from small-capitalization value stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, small-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the financial sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.</li></ul>",

Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions.

Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider.

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s target index tracks a subset of the U.S. stock market, which could cause the fund to perform differently from the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>, which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund seeks to invest all, or substantially all, of its assets in the communication services sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the communication services sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, competition, and government regulation. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund’s share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Sector risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the consumer staples sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the consumer staples sector could be affected by, among other things, consumer tastes, government regulation, marketing, and consumer confidence. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund’s share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Sector risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the energy sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the energy sector could be affected by, among other things, geopolitical events, government regulation, economic cycles, and fuel prices. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund’s share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:&nbsp;</b>The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Sector risk:</b> The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the health care sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the health care sector could be affected by, among other things, patent protection, government regulation, research and development costs, litigation, and competitive forces. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:</b> The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks:</b> The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices.

Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the industrials sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector.

These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks.

Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider.

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the materials sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the materials sector could be affected by, among other things, commodity prices, government regulation, inflation expectations, resource availability, and economic cycles. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund’s share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>: The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide.

The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Industry concentration risk: </b>The chance that the stocks of REITs and other real estate-related investments will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the fund concentrates its assets in real estate stocks, industry concentration risk is high.</li><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Interest rate risk: </b>The chance that REIT stock prices overall will decline, and that the cost of borrowing for REITs will increase because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk is high for the portfolio.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that the returns from REIT stocks—which frequently are small- or mid-capitalization stocks—will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, REIT stocks have performed quite differently from the overall market.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk: </b>The chance that the fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer or group of issuers or may own larger positions of an issuer’s voting stock than a diversified fund.</li></ul>",

The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies. Because the fund seeks to track its target index, the fund may underperform the overall stock market.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because the fund invests all, or substantially all, of its assets in the utilities sector, the fund’s performance largely depends—for better or for worse—on the general condition of that sector. Companies in the utilities sector could be affected by government regulation, overall economic conditions, and fuel prices. Sector risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: The chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a small number of issuers as compared with other mutual funds. Because the fund tends to invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in its ten largest holdings, fluctuations in the market value of a single fund holding could cause significant changes to the fund’s share price. Nondiversification risk is expected to be high for the fund.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>: The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and mid-size companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks</b>: The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.&nbsp;</li></ul>",

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Investment style risk,</b> which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. growth stocks and, to the extent that the fund is invested in them, small- and mid-cap stocks, will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Stock market risk,</b> which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk,</b> which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in anyone country or region, including emerging markets, the fund’s performance maybe hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk,</b> which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:</b> The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk,</b> which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Manager risk,</b> which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk,</b> which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk,</b> which is the chance that the fund’s performance maybe hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market.

Small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.

There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The advisor’s assessment of a company may differ from that of other funds advised by the same or a different advisor or of an investor’s assessment of such company.

      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Significant investments in Japan and the United Kingdom (U.K.) subject the Index and the fund to proportionately higher exposure to Japanese and U.K. country risk.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li></ul>",

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk,</b> which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk,</b> which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk,</b> which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk,</b> which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Investment style risk, </b>which is the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from global stock markets. Small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the global market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li><li><b>Manager risk,</b> which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the financial sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets. The index’s, and therefore the fund’s, heavy exposure to China, Brazil, and Taiwan subjects the fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:</b> The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks.

Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/Regional risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets. The index’s, and therefore the fund’s, heavy exposure to China, Brazil, and Taiwan subjects the fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:</b> The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/Regional risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets. The index’s, and therefore the fund’s, heavy exposure to China, Brazil, and Taiwan subjects the fund to a higher degree of country risk than that of more geographically diversified international funds.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:</b> The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk:</b>&nbsp;The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Sector risk</b>: The chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily fluctuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than fluctuations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund’s assets are in the information technology sector, the fund’s performance is impacted by the general condition of that sector. Companies in the information technology sector could be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions, short product cycles, rapid obsolescence of products, competition, and government regulation.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk</b>: Because the fund seeks to closely track the composition of the fund's target index, from time to time, more than 25% of the fund's total assets may be invested in issuers representing more than 5% of the fund's total assets due to an index rebalance or market movement, which would result in the fund being nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks, or even a single stock, and the fund’s shares may experience significant fluctuations in value.</li></ul>",

Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider.

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stock markets can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk:</b> The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b> The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:&nbsp;</b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b> The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b> The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stock markets can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk:</b> The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b> The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:&nbsp;</b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b> The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk.

Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk:</b> The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/Regional risk:</b> The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/Regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk:</b> The chance the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk:</b> The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk:</b> The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Investment style risk:</b> The chance that returns from non-U.S. small-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, non-U.S. small-capitalization stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.</li></ul>",

      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund&#8217;s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund&#8217;s performance could be hurt by: <ul> <li><strong>Stock market risk</strong>: the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund&#8217;s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li> <li><strong>Investment style risk</strong>: the chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from global stock markets. Small-, mid-, and large-capitalization stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better&#8212;or worse&#8212;than other segments of the stock market or the global stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. Small and midsize companies tend to have greater stock volatility because, among other things, these companies are more sensitive to changing economic conditions.</li> <li><strong>Manager risk</strong>: the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li> <li><strong>Country/regional risk</strong>: the chance that world events&#8212;such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters&#8212;will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.&#160;</li> <li><strong>Currency risk</strong>: the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.&#160;</li> <li><strong>Industry concentration risk</strong>: the chance that there will be particular problems affecting an entire industry. Any fund that concentrates in a particular industry will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly. The precious metals and mining industry could be affected by sharp price volatility caused by global economic, financial, and political factors. Resource availability, government regulation, inflation expectations and economic cycles could also adversely affect that industry.&#160;</li> <li><strong>Nondiversification risk:</strong> the chance that the fund&#8217;s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks or even a single stock. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li> </ul><UL></UL>",

The fund’s advisor selects securities for the fund based on the ESG criteria disclosed in the fund’s principal investment strategies. Using ESG criteria could result in the fund investing in securities that trail the returns of other funds that use ESG criteria or in the fund underperforming the market as a whole. Interpretations of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics can – and do – vary significantly across individuals, index providers, advisors, and other funds that use ESG criteria. As a result, the fund’s disclosed ESG criteria, or the advisor’s assessment of whether or not a company or issuer meets the fund’s disclosed ESG criteria, may not align with your personal view of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics. Further, individual securities held by the fund may not reflect your personal preferences, beliefs, expectations, and/or values. In order to assess a company or issuer against the fund’s disclosed ESG criteria, the advisor depends on the availability of data obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. There can be no assurance that this data will be accurate, complete, or current, which could result in an inaccurate assessment of a company or issuer.</li><li><b>Environmental-focused investing risk,</b> which is the risk that the fund's focus on environmental companies limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the fund and, as a result, the fund may underperform other funds that do not have such a focus. The fund's environmental-focused investment strategy may result in the fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or forgoing opportunities to invest in securities that might otherwise be advantageous to buy. Additionally, if a particular security held by the fund no longer meets the environmental criteria subsequent to the time of investment, the fund may sell such investments at an inopportune time or at a time when those investments may be difficult to sell. In addition, the fund may incur expenses in an effort to dispose of such investments. The fund's focus on securities of environmental companies means the fund will be more susceptible to events or factors affecting these companies, and the market prices of its portfolio securities may be more volatile than those of funds that are more diversified. Some environmental companies may have more limited operating histories and smaller market capitalizations on average than companies in other sectors. In addition, the fund is particularly susceptible to changes in global and regional climates, environmental protection regulatory actions, changes in government standards and subsidy levels, changes in taxation and other domestic and international and political, regulatory and economic developments.</li><li><b>Investment style risk,</b> which is the chance that returns from the types of growth stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. Small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks each tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. Historically, small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than large-cap stocks. The stock prices of small and mid-size companies tend to experience greater volatility because, among other things, these companies tend to be more sensitive to changing economic conditions. The long-term investment approach of the fund may cause the fund to lose money or underperform compared to its benchmark index or other mutual funds over extended periods of time, and the fund may not perform as expected in the long term. An investment in the fund may be more suitable for long-term investors who can bear the risk of short- or medium-term fluctuations in the value of the fund's portfolio.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk,</b> which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest its assets in securities of companies located in emerging markets, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk, </b>which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging and frontier markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:</b> The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Nondiversification risk,</b> which is the chance that the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few investments. The fund is considered nondiversified, which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the instruments of particular issuers as compared with diversified mutual funds.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk,</b> which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund's performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li><li><b>Sector risk,</b> which is the chance that significant problems will affect a particular sector, or that returns from that sector will trail returns from the overall stock market. Daily flucuations in specific market sectors are often more extreme or volatile than flucations in the overall market. Because a significant portion of the fund's assets are invested in the industrials, information technology, and utilities sectors, the fund's performance is impacted by the general condition of those sectors.</li><li><b>Currency risk, </b>which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Manager risk,</b> which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund's share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund's performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk,</b> which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund's investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>ESG investing risks:</b> The fund is subject to ESG investing risks. The fund’s advisor selects securities for the fund based on the ESG criteria disclosed in the fund’s principal investment strategies. Using ESG criteria could result in the fund investing in securities that trail the returns of other funds that use ESG criteria or in the fund underperforming the market as a whole. Interpretations of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics can – and do – vary significantly across individuals, index providers, advisors, and other funds that use ESG criteria. As a result, the fund’s disclosed ESG criteria, or the advisor’s assessment of whether or not a company or issuer meets the fund’s disclosed ESG criteria, may not align with your personal view of what it means for a company or issuer to exhibit ESG characteristics.

The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk</b>, which is the chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li><li><b>ESG investing risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks selected by the advisor based on its ESG criteria generally will underperform the stock market as a whole or that the particular stocks selected by the advisor based on its ESG criteria will, in the aggregate, trail returns of other ESG funds. There are significant differences in interpretations of what it means for a company to meet ESG criteria. The advisor’s assessment of a company may differ from that of other funds or an investor’s assessment of such company. As a result, stocks selected by the advisor may not reflect the beliefs and values of any particular investor. The advisor is dependent on the availability of timely and accurate ESG data being reported by companies to evaluate their ESG criteria. The advisor’s ESG criteria may, at times, result in the fund becoming focused in the stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Industry concentration risk</b>, which is the chance that real estate stocks will decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. Because the fund concentrates its assets in real estate stocks, industry concentration risk is high. The real estate industry can be adversely affected by, among other things, the value of securities of issuers in the real estate industry, including REITs and REMDs, and changes in real estate values and rental income, property taxes, interest rates, and demographics.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from real estate securities— which frequently are small- or mid-capitalization stocks—will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, real estate securities have performed quite differently from the global stock markets.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks:</b> The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a limited number of companies, which could cause the fund to underperform the global stock markets.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund may invest in derivatives, which may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",

Historically, real estate securities have performed quite differently from the global stock markets.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks:</b> The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk.

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk: </b>The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk: </b>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that returns from non-U.S. mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk: </b>The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

Historically, non-U.S. mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk: </b>The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from dividend-paying stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Dividend-paying stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than the global markets in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks:</b> The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk</b>, which is the chance that, because the fund’s target index (and therefore the fund) tends to be heavily weighted in its ten largest holdings, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li></ul>",

In general, such funds are appropriate for investors who have a long-term investment horizon (ten years or longer), who are seeking growth in capital as a primary objective, and who are prepared to endure the sharp and sometimes prolonged declines in share prices that occur from time to time in the stock market. This price volatility is the trade-off for the potentially high returns that common stocks can provide. The level of current income produced by funds in this category ranges from moderate to very low.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investments in the consumer staples and health care sectors subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of these sectors.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>: The chance that returns from dividend-paying, large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Asset concentration risk</b>: The chance that, because the fund tends to invest a high percentage of assets in its ten largest holdings, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few stocks.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>: The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets insecurities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>: The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Investment style risk, </b>which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. growth stocks and, to the extent that the fund is invested in them, small- and mid-cap stocks, will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Stock market risk,</b> which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk,</b> which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, including emerging markets, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk,</b> which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Manager risk,</b> which is the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective. In addition, significant investment in the consumer discretionary sector subjects the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of this sector.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk, </b>which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China:</b> The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li></ul>",

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from dividend-paying stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Dividend-paying stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than the global markets in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index. Index sampling risk for the fund is expected to be low.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul>",

You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk: </b>The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.</li><li><b>Currency risk: </b>The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.</li><li><b>Country/Regional risk: </b>The&nbsp;chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/Regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging Markets risk: </b>The chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Investment style risk: </b>The chance that returns from the types of stocks in which the fund invests will trail returns from the overall stock market. As a group, non-U.S. value stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years. The fund also may invest in small- and mid-capitalization stocks. Historically, these stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Manager risk: </b>The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.</li></ul>",

Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions.

Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions.

Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk.

Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions.

      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short or long periods of time. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range. The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small-and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Investment style risk</b>, which is the chance that returns from non-U.S. small-and mid-capitalization stocks will trail returns from global stock markets. Historically, non-U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the global markets, and they often perform quite differently.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, and accounting systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Special risks of investing in China: </b>The fund’s investments in companies or issuers economically tied to China are subject to the country/regional, emerging markets, and currency risks described above, in addition to unique risks. Investments economically tied to China are associated with considerable degrees of social and humanitarian, legal, regulatory, political, and economic uncertainty. Risks described above may be more pronounced for the fund. All of these factors, among others, could have negative impacts on the fund. For example, the fund may not be able to access its desired amount of shares of companies incorporated in China that trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges (A-shares) and/or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (H-shares), which may cause the fund to miss out on investment opportunities. Investments economically tied to China may be (or become in the future) restricted or sanctioned by the U.S. government or another government, which could cause these securities to decline in value or become less liquid. If the fund’s holdings become impacted by restrictions or sanctions, the fund may incur losses. Additionally, the fund may gain exposure to certain companies in China through legal structures known as variable interest entities (VIEs), which provide exposure to Chinese companies through contractual arrangements instead of equity ownership. Investing through a VIE does not offer the same level of investor protection as direct ownership and is subject to risks including breach of the contractual arrangements, difficulty in enforcing the contractual arrangements outside of the U.S., and intervention by the U.S. government. These risks could significantly affect a VIE’s market value, which in turn could impact the fund’s performance.</li><li><b>Index replicating risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund may be prevented from holding one or more securities in the same proportion as in its target index.</li><li><b>Index-related risks: </b>The fund is subject to risks associated with index investing, which include passive management risk, tracking error risk, and index provider risk. Passive management risk is the chance that the fund's use of an indexing strategy will negatively impact the fund's performance. Because the fund seeks to track the performance of its target index regardless of how that index is performing, the fund's performance may be lower than it would be if the fund were actively managed. Tracking error risk is the chance that the fund's performance will deviate from the performance of its target index. Tracking error risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or under other unusual market conditions. Index provider risk is the chance that the fund will be negatively impacted by changes or errors made by the index provider. Any gains, losses, or costs associated with or resulting from an error made by the index provider will generally be borne by the fund and, as a result, the fund's shareholders.</li></ul><ul></ul>",

The fund is subject to the following risks, which could affect the fund’s performance:</p><ul><li><b>Stock market risk</b>, which is the chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions. In addition, the fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular market sector, which would subject the fund to proportionately higher exposure to the risks of that sector.</li><li><b>Country/regional risk</b>, which is the chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Emerging markets risk</b>, which is the chance that the stocks of companies located in emerging markets will be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the stocks of companies located in more developed foreign markets because, among other factors, emerging markets can have greater custodial and operational risks; less developed legal, tax, regulatory, financial reporting, accounting, and recordkeeping systems; and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.</li><li><b>Currency risk</b>, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Currency risk is especially high in emerging markets.</li><li><b>Index sampling risk</b>, which is the chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the fund’s target index.

      "code": 5,
      "level": "Aggressive",
      "levelDesc": "<p>Vanguard funds classified as aggressive are subject to extremely wide fluctuations in share prices. The unusually high volatility associated with these funds may stem from one or more of the following strategies: a concentration of fund holdings in a relatively low number of individual stocks, or in a particular sector of the stock market, or in a particular geographical region of the world; a heavy emphasis on small-capitalization stocks or growth stocks with relatively high market valuations; holdings of international stocks or bonds, which are subject to price declines caused by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies; or investments in bonds that have exceptionally long average durations, whose prices are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>",
      "plainTalk": "<p>An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time. Returns may vary substantially over time, and there can be no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment objective or that its investment strategy will succeed. The fund’s investment strategy involves the use of leverage, so its investment program may be considered speculative and is expected to involve considerable risks. The fund could lose money at any time and may underperform the commodities markets during any given period, regardless of whether such markets rise or fall. The fund is subject to the risks described below. Each of these risks, alone or in combination with other risks, has the potential to hurt the fund’s performance, sometimes significantly, and the level of risk may vary based on market conditions. The fund’s performance could be hurt by:</p><ul><li><b>Commodity-linked investment risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund could lose all, or substantially all, of its investments in instruments linked to the returns of commodity investments. The commodities markets are volatile, and even a small movement in market prices could cause large losses. Prices of commodity-linked investments have a historically low correlation with the returns of the stock and bond markets and are subject to change based on a variety of factors that may not be anticipated by the fund’s advisor.</li><li><b>Derivatives risk</b>. The fund’s direct and indirect commodity-linked investments—such as commodity-linked total return swaps, commodity futures contracts and options on commodity futures contracts, commodity-linked structured notes, exchange-traded commodity pools or funds, and other commodity-linked derivative instruments—subject the fund to risks associated with derivatives. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. The use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying commodity or index. Derivative strategies often involve leverage, which may increase a loss, potentially causing the fund to lose more money than it would have lost had it invested in the underlying commodity or index. Also, a liquid market may not always exist for the fund’s derivative positions at times when the fund might wish to terminate or sell such positions. In addition, regulators and futures exchanges have established limits, referred to as position limits, on the maximum net long or net short positions that any person may hold or control in particular derivative contracts. Some contract positions, such as commodity futures contracts, held by the fund and/or the subsidiary may have to be liquidated at disadvantageous times or prices to avoid exceeding such position limits, which could adversely affect the fund’s total return. The use of a derivative subjects the investor to the risk of nonperformance by the counterparty (i.e., counterparty risk), potentially resulting in delayed or partial payment or even nonpayment of amounts due under the derivative contract.</li><li><b>Tax risk</b>, which is the chance that the fund’s commodity-linked investments could adversely affect the fund’s status as a regulated investment company.</li><li><b>Inflation-linked investment risks</b>. The fund’s annual income distributions are likely to fluctuate considerably. Under certain conditions, the fund may not have any income to distribute. Overall, investors can expect income fluctuations to be high for the fund. The fund is also subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance that the value of a bond will fluctuate because of a change in the level of interest rates. Although inflation-indexed bonds seek to provide inflation protection, their prices may decline when interest rates rise and vice versa.</li><li><b>Other fixed income investment risks</b>. To the extent that the fund invests in other fixed income securities, such as cash instruments or short-term bonds, the fund is subject to income risk, credit risk, and call risk.</li><li><b>Subsidiary investment risk</b>. The fund is subject to risks associated with subsidiary investments. In particular, because the subsidiary is not organized as a mutual fund and is not registered under any federal or state securities laws (including the Investment Company Act of 1940), it does not offer the same investor protections available to shareholders of registered investment 4 companies. In addition, the tax treatment of the fund’s investment in the subsidiary may be adversely affected by changes in the laws or regulations, or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, of the United States and/or the jurisdiction of the subsidiary. The fund’s ownership of the subsidiary subjects it to the same risks as if it were invested directly in the assets owned by the subsidiary. Risks associated with the subsidiary’s underlying investments have been described elsewhere in the prospectus and include commodity-linked investment risk, derivatives risk, tax risk, inflation-linked investment risks, other fixed income investment risks, and manager risk.</li><li><b>Leverage risk</b>, which is the chance that any leveraged losses will exceed the principal amount invested by the fund. Returns from a leveraged investment have the potential to be more volatile than returns from traditional stock and bond investments, which exposes the fund to heightened risks.</li><li><b>Manager risk</b>, which is the chance that poor investment selection and/or poor strategy execution will cause the fund and/or the subsidiary to fail to achieve its investment objective or generate lower returns than would be achieved from different investment selections. Poor investment selection by the advisor could also cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar investment objectives.</li><li><b>Liquidity risk</b>, which is the chance that the markets, assets and instruments in which the fund invests are, or may become, illiquid. There is no assurance that investments that were liquid when purchased will not suddenly become illiquid for an indefinite period of time.</li></ul>",
